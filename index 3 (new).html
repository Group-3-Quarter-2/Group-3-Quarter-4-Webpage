        <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;"> Question 1: Why are homes damaged during typhoons?</h3>
        <li>Answer: Homes may or may not be damaged during typhoons due to the varying durability of materials used in making homes. However, houses made with weak materials or constructed improperly or not up to standard with national building code, there may be a high chance of the house getting damaged due to the strong, high wind speeds that is caused by the typhoon. </li>
        <br>
        <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;"> Question 2: Why do typhoons occur?</h3>
        <li>Answer: Warm water can contribute to the formation of a typhoon by being a source of energy. The warm surface of the ocean water would transfer water vapor and heat into the overlying air. As the warm air rises, it cools and expands releasing latent heat through condensation, moistening the developing typhoon. And the temperature difference from the warm, rising air and the cooler environment would further enhance the upward movement.</li>
        </li><br><h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Question 3: Why do certain regions experience higher moisture levels?</h3>
        <li>Answer: There are different reasons why some regions experience higher moisture levels. Certain areas have higher levels of moisture due to a variety of factors, including topography, strong winds, climate, plants, and patterns of weather. In certain regions, a combination of meteorological and geographic conditions results in greater moisture content. Being near large bodies of water, such as lakes, seas, or oceans, can cause an increase in moisture due to evaporation and followed by air movement. Other topographical features, such as mountains, can also have an effect on precipitation patterns by creating wetter conditions on one side and rain shadows on another. Main pattern of wind can also have a major impact on the movement of moisture-laden air masses among various regions.</li>
        <br><h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;"> Question 4: Why do warm ocean temperatures contribute to typhoon formulation?</h3>
        <li>Answer: Evaporations from warm ocean waters add moisture to the atmosphere, this moisture environment provides the fuel needed for the development of thunderstorms which are the building blocks of a typhoon.
        </li><br><h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Question 5: Why do typhoons pose significant risks to coastal communities</h3>
        <li>Answer: Typhoons pose a serious threat to coastal communities because of their combination of high winds, which can seriously harm buildings and vegetation, storm surges, which cause swift sea level rise and severe coastal flooding, heavy rainfall, which increases the risk of landslides and inland flooding, coastal erosion, which makes coastal areas more vulnerable, and the disruption of vital services like power, water, and communication networks, all of which can have a substantial impact on a community's capacity to respond to and recover from the storm's effects.

        <h2 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui; text-align: center;"> Proposed Solution to Mitigate the Impact of Typhoons </h3>
            <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Building Code Enforcement:</h3> <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Strengthening the enforcement of building codes to ensure that homes are constructed with materials and techniques that can withstand typhoon-force winds. This addresses Kean's point about the importance of proper construction standards. </h3>    
             <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Early Warning Systems: </h3> <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;"> Enhancing early warning systems to provide timely and accurate information about approaching typhoons, including forecasts for wind speed, rainfall, and storm surge. This builds upon Rogelio's explanation of how warm ocean waters contribute to typhoon formation and emphasizes the importance of early detection and preparedness. </h3>
            <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Managing Moisture Levels and Topography:</h3>
            <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Implement land-use planning strategies that consider topographical features to mitigate the impact of typhoon-related hazards, building on Abi's insights on moisture distribution and geographical factors.
            Develop measures to manage moisture levels in vulnerable areas, such as improved drainage systems and vegetation management, based on Abi's explanation of moisture distribution factors. 
            <br> <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Environmental Conservation: Implementing measures to preserve natural barriers like mangroves and wetlands, which can help mitigate the impact of storm surges and coastal erosion. This supports Matthew's point about the role of warm ocean waters in fueling typhoons and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy marine environment.</h3>
            <h3 style="color: white; font-family: segoe ui;">Climate Resilient Infrastructure: Investing in infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of typhoons, such as storm-resistant buildings, elevated roads, and flood protection systems. This aligns with Ruben's observation about the threat typhoons pose to coastal communities and the need to protect vital infrastructure.</h3>
