        <li>Question 1: Why are homes damaged during typhoons?</li>
        <li>Answer: Homes may or may not be damaged during typhoons due to the varying durability of materials used in making homes. However, houses made with weak materials or constructed improperly or not up to standard with national building code, there may be a high chance of the house getting damaged due to the strong, high wind speeds that is caused by the typhoon. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Question 2: Why do typhoons occur?</li>
        <li>Answer: Warm water can contribute to the formation of a typhoon by being a source of energy. The warm surface of the ocean water would transfer water vapor and heat into the overlying air. As the warm air rises, it cools and expands releasing latent heat through condensation, moistening the developing typhoon. And the temperature difference from the warm, rising air and the cooler environment would further enhance the upward movement.</li>
        </li><br><li>Question 3: Why do certain regions experience higher moisture levels?</li>
        <li>Answer: </li>
        <br><li>Question 4: Why do warm ocean temperatures contribute to typhoon formulation?</li>
        <li>Answer: Evaporations from warm ocean waters add moisture to the atmosphere, this moisture environment provides the fuel needed for the development of thunderstorms which are the building blocks of a typhoon.
        </li><br><li>Question 5: Why do typhoons pose significant risks to coastal communities</li>
        <li>Answer: Typhoons pose a serious threat to coastal communities because of their combination of high winds, which can seriously harm buildings and vegetation, storm surges, which cause swift sea level rise and severe coastal flooding, heavy rainfall, which increases the risk of landslides and inland flooding, coastal erosion, which makes coastal areas more vulnerable, and the disruption of vital services like power, water, and communication networks, all of which can have a substantial impact on a community's capacity to respond to and recover from the storm's effects.
